Trunk Posture Monitoring with IMU and MATLAB is a real-time system designed to track the flexion and extension of the human torso using the inertial sensors of a smartphone. Leveraging MATLAB Mobile for data acquisition and MATLAB Online for signal processing and visualization, the system computes the inclination angle of the trunk based on acceleration data and displays it on an intuitive polar diagram.

The system updates in real time and provides clear visual feedback on the userâ€™s posture, making it a valuable tool in several fields:

ðŸ”¹ Physical rehabilitation â€“ to monitor patient progress and adjust therapy plans.

ðŸ”¹ Ergonomics â€“ to detect and correct poor posture in workplace environments.

ðŸ”¹ Sports science â€“ to optimize performance and prevent injuries through motion analysis.

With a sampling rate of 100 Hz, the system ensures high-resolution data capture. The visual interface includes degree markings and real-time angle feedback, enhancing usability for both research and practical applications.
